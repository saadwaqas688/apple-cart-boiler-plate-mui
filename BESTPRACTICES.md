Best Practices 

 

Folder Name For components:  

Use descriptive and meaningful names for your Folder. Folder names should be in Pascal Case (e.g., MyComponent) and start with an uppercase letter. 

 

Page Folder Name: 

Use descriptive and meaningful names for your Page Folder. Page folder names should be in kebab-case (e.g., my-page) 

Note: There should be only one main Component in page  and the name should be suffix with Page i.e SignUpPage

Component Name:  

Use descriptive and meaningful names for your components. Component names should be in PascalCase e.g., MyComponent. 
Component file name is index.tsx



Variable,css Class and Function Name: 

 use camel case for variable and function names. Camelcase means starting with a lowercase letter and using uppercase letters to separate words, e.g., myVariableName. 

Css class name should be in kebab-case (e.g,my-page) 

 

Component Modularity: 

 Keep components small. Break down complex components into smaller, reusable components. 


 Conditional Rendering:  

Use conditional statements (e.g., if, ternary operators) to conditionally render parts of a component. 

Avoid complex logic in JSX. If your rendering logic becomes too complex, consider extracting it into helper functions or separate components 

 

Comments:  

Write comments for complex logic or non-obvious behavior  

 

Error Handling: 

Implement proper error handling in your components, including validation of incoming props and handling unexpected errors gracefully. 

 

 

Remove or Comment Out Debugging Statements: 

Before committing, ensure that all debugging statements, including console statements, are removed or commented out 

 

Absolute Path: 

Use Absolute path instead of relative path 

Absolute paths are paths that specify the exact location of a file or module in the project, regardless of the current file's location 

e.g import MyComponent from “@components/MyComponent” (absolute path) 

 Import MyComponent from “../../components/ComponentName” 

 

Local utils: 

Keep the component level function in separate file with in same folder along with component  e.g functions in MyComponent component should be placed in MyComponent.ts file 


IsNullOREmpty Global utility function: 

Object ,array and string every thing should be checked through isNullOrEmpty utility funciton 

 

Commit Message: 
 

Keep commit message elaborative .Meaningful summary
